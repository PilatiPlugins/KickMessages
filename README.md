# KickMessages

A plugin for bungeecord that displays in the chat the reason why the player was kicked from the server 

Minecraft 1.20 changed and clears the chat every time the user connects to another server (which includes server swaps from a network)

The kick message ends up being hidden and this plugin shows it to the player
